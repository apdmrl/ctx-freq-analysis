There are variety of tools available to assist in illustrating the frequency of letters in the input text and even comparing it to the language of choice. More specifically, frequency analysis tools are a sort of cryptanalysis that focuses on counting individual letters or groups of letters like n-grams in an encrypted text in order to help in the decryption of relative document. However, there is no tool that approaches frequency analysis from contextual perspective and analyzes the statistics as a whole. In this project, the Contextual Frequency Analysis Tool is designed to contextualize the frequencies and to present them in unity. In order to use the tool, the contexts with frequencies must be created. After, ciphertext is submitted, the tool proposes compatible contexts for ciphertext by comparing its frequencies with the dataset using Pearson's chi-square test.
